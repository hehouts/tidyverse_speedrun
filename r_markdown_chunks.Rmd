```



## Types of Rmd chunks:

This is a standard chunk
```{r}
x <- "hi!"
print(x)
```


this is if `eval = FALSE`
```{r, eval=FALSE}
x <- "eval is false!"
print(x)
```

(Print in a new chunk, where eval is not set to false)
```{r}
print(x)
```

This is if `echo = FALSE`
```{r, echo =FALSE}
#this is code
x<- "hi, x was changed, but the code is hidden!"
#code
#code-y code-code
print(x)
```

note `message`, `warning`, and `error`
